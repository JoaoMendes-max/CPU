# Rules to enforce on GitHub

Note: live GitHub issue/PR templates are in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
This folder contains planning/reference material only.

The workflow will be as follows:

1. **One issue → one branch → one pull request.**
2. Every issue has AT LEAST 2 labels: **one priority** (`P0/P1/P2`) + **one area** (`pipeline/compiler/peripherals`).
3. Every PR must contain **Fixes #ID** and **How to test**.
4. Branches must be cut from latest `main`, kept in sync with `main` while open, and updated before merge.

Quick commands:

```bash
# start
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>

# keep synced (preferred)
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Issue naming convention

Issue names are: `<type>/<short description>`, where `<type>` is one of `pipeline/compiler/peripherals/bug` and the description is a short action verb phrase. 

For example: `pipeline/add IF/ID stage register + valid`.

## Branch naming convention

`<type>/<short description>`, where `<type>` is one of `pipeline/compiler/peripherals/bug` and the description is a short action verb phrase. 

For example: `pipeline/add-IF-ID-stage-register`.

This **should match** the issue name, but with dashes instead of spaces and no labels.
